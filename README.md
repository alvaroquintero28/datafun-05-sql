Create a GitHub project repository with a default README.md.
Clone your repo down to your machine. 
Open your project folder in VS Code (if you haven't already).
Add a useful .gitignore with a line for .vsode/ and .venv/ and whatever else doesn't need to go in the repo. 
Create and activate a local virtual environment in .venv.
Install your dependencies into your .venv (pandas and pyarrow) and freeze into your requirements.txt. 
Record the commands used in your README.md.
Git add and commit with a useful message (e.g. "initial commit") and push to GitHub.
Create your first project files (usually in VS Code). 
As you work, git add / commit / push to GitHub.
